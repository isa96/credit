# Credit

Task Background
Credit is currently using various statistical methods and Machine Learning to make credit score predictions. 
Now, we ask you to unlock the full potential of our data. By doing so, we can ensure that customers who are able to 
repay are not turned down when applying for a loan, and that loans can be provided with a principal, maturity, and repayment 
calendar that will motivate customers to succeed. Evaluation will be carried out by checking how deep your understanding of the analysis 
you are working on is. For the record, you need to use at least 2 Machine Learning models where one of them is Logistic Regression. 
After that, make a presentation slide containing end-to-end analysis of modeling results along with business recommendations (maximum 10 pages)

Stages of Work
1. Download the required Dataset.
2. Study the context of the problem from external sources to increase Subject Matter Knowledge.
3. Understand the available column descriptions.
4. Determine the goals, objectives, and metrics of the existing problems.
5. Extract information related to the condition of the initial data.
6. Perform Data Cleaning and Data Processing processes.
7. Carry out the process of extracting insights referring to the objectives that have been set.
8. Perform modeling with various methods (including Logistic Regression) and hyperparameters.
9. Evaluation of modeling results.
10. Measure how much impact business modeling and recommendations have on predefined metrics.
11. Push your .ipynb file into github.
12. Create a presentation file to explain the work that has been done and include the github repo link in the ppt
